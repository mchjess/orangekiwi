** Purpose of the program:

This program is intended for education purposes only. I am a new dev creating portfolio pieces while I learn. All constructive feedback is welcome and appreciated (C) Jessica McHenry 2024

** Credits:

This project was inspired by GoodBrief, a free design brief generator, made by Manu: https://manu.coffee/.

The colour palette was created using https://coolors.co/.

The kiwi fruit image from the header was taken from an article here: https://weresmartworld.com/fruit-year-2023-kiwi.
Image source pathway: https://weresmartworld.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_screen/public/2022-12/Kiwi-fruit-of-the-year-2023-04.jpg?itok=vtvp2IJC

All graphic design was completed by the dev using Adobe Creative Suite.

** PROJECT DETAILS **

The website brief is located in this repo.

My client is Orange Kiwi, an affordable travel company pitched toward college students looking for fun, friendly trips around the world. They're brand colour is black (which isn't very approachable) and their USP is that their travel experts guarantee the best price on the most popular destinations. The client wishes to covey kindness, approachability, comfort and safety. They want their website to drive traffic to contact their agents. They have some merch so there will need to be:

    *Landing Page (which contact details and a way to contact them directly)
    *An about page
    *A shop page
    *A blog page

I started my research with a colour palette:

/* CSS HEX */
--baby-powder: #fafffdff;
--raisin-black: #342e37ff;
--tufts-blue: #3c91e6ff;
--yellow-green: #9fd356ff;
--persimmon: #F15F1Aff;

And an image of a kiwi fruit I new I wanted to make the header image for the website design.

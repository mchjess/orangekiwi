    <p>Stop wishing your life away and start making plans. Real plans to travel abroad. </p>
      <p>I was having lunch with a friend a few weeks ago and we spent the whole conversation swapping travel wish lists and whining about how we'll never have the time to plan where we want to go let alone the time to actually visit and enjoy those destinations. At the time, the conversation felt normal; like I was venting. It was only afterward that I began to question whether time really was the problem I had.</p>
